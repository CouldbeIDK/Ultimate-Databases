###Overview
Ultimate Bravery was a community-made custom game mode for the game League of Legends. It would randomly pick out a champion for a player, as well as a random assortment of items for the player to build. I am hoping to make the program as well, hopefully with a few improvements. 

###Setup
First you will need to make sure you are using Ruby 2.1.1 or above. next you will need to install the required gems for these programs. We have included a gem called bundler that will install all other gems in one step from the gemfile included.
```sh
$gem install bundler
$bundle install

```
Next, you will need to run the Entry script to populate the database.
```sh
$ruby Entry.rb
```
###Run
To run the the Ultimate Bravery generator at this point, you simply need to tell ruby to BeBrave!
```sh
$ruby BeBrave.rb
```
Run it as many times as you want from here, and it will continue to generate builds for you.
